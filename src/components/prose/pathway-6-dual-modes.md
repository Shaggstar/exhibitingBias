Cognition seems to involve an important dichotomy of attention that are essential in symbolic processing, often analogized between [spot and flood lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zLEumT1J8s).  The **analytic (spot light) mode** parses information sequentially, isolating a particular narrow field and diving into to its depths. The **gestalt (flood light) mode** sees wholes. It employs analogies and perhaps other tropes from rhetoric to toggle and compare/contrast different fields of information.  

Each is indispensable but by itself is incomplete. Take language, individual expressions carries semantic, gestalt meaning that can be parsed into individual words, and words can be parsed into individual letters that independently do not carry that meaning.  While many popular and studied accounts of this dichotomy exist in cognitive science it has not been fully represented in active inference. I propose that Transcendental Model Selection and Inference offer an important means of filling this gap. 

John Vervaeke and John Kennedy contrasted analytic and metaphorical reasoning, arguing that both are needed for intelligence (Vervaeke and Kennedy 2004). Douglas Hofstadter and Emmanuel Sanders used the terms essence and surface to capture the same duality (Hofstadter and Sanders 2013). Iain McGilchrist, similar to Henrich, argued that Western culture privileges the analytic through left-brain dominance, at the expense of holistic attention (McGilchrist 2009; Henrich 2020). 

In the metaphysical/artistic tradition that has come up a few times at least. Robert Pirsig described the same polarity in his popular book *Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,* as the **classic** versus **romantic** stance, where classic represents an analytical orientation necessary for both professorial oriented deep dives on topics, and also relevant when it comes to the nuances of hiking and engaging in the art motorcycle maintenance. While often regular art and music involve more of a romantic orientation (Pirsig 1974).  William Blake criticized Newton’s singular vision and urged a return to what he called fourfold vision (Higgs 2021).

At its core the idea of seeing things at a high level (gestalt) versus lower level (analytical) is likely captured in the hierarchical representation of cognitive predictions. Predictions are formed at *higher levels* that cascade predictions downward through the hierarchy while prediction errors, specifically updates to precision (inverse variance), are sent upwards. Lower levels engaging in higher dimensional and hence the nuance or details while the higher levels predictions involve the *big picture.* 

This is true of all cognition, hence all animals that need to form a model of a predator's behavior, the cause and effect sequence of a gathering storm versus the split section decision when a rabbit has to decide between seeking shelter in the midst of a hurricane and facing an aggressive fox is likely a higher level predictive task. 

However given that symbolic cognition likely involves our more recently involve brain regions, i.e. the Default Mode Network it likely involves specific treatment and a tighter connection between this two modes and our ability to oscillate between them.  In my own terms, transcendental model selection and inference represent gestalt and analytic respectively. 

Transcendent Inference represents the analytic mode that allows us to navigated the depth of epistemic hierarchy, beginning understanding the nature of how a given agent is particularly constrained in a social context but cultural moral constraints.  While  the gestalt mode enables cross-context integration through bayesian structure learning or model selection, beginning by enabling us to infer an agent's allegiance to the group through signaling their epistemic depth.  This can generalize into the metaphoric and rhetorical figures of speech.  Allowing us to compare ideas compressed into particular higher level models and compared/contrasted to others based on similarities along specific parameters.

Cognition unfolds through two modes. The analytic mode parses information sequentially, dividing and isolating. The gestalt mode sees wholes, analogies, and patterns. Each is indispensable, but each by itself is incomplete.

John Vervaeke and John Kennedy contrasted analytic and metaphorical reasoning, arguing that both are needed for intelligence. Robert Pirsig described the same polarity as the classic versus romantic stance, observing that quality lies beyond either mode (Pirsig 1974). Douglas Hofstadter and Emmanuel Sanders used the terms essence and surface to capture the same duality (Hofstadter and Sanders 2013).

Iain McGilchrist, similar to Henrich, argued that Western culture privileges the analytic through left-brain dominance, at the expense of holistic attention (McGilchrist 2009; Henrich 2020). William Blake criticized Newton’s singular vision and urged a return to what he called fourfold vision (Higgs 2021). In my own terms, transcendental model selection requires both. The analytic mode deepens epistemic hierarchy, while the gestalt mode enables cross-context integration. Together they stabilize the balance between depth and breadth.
