The Author Dostoevsky knew the perils of attempting to apply WEIRD analytically oriented reductive tendencies towards morality. This applies to both utilitarianism and deontology, the two dominant schools in Western Philosophy. Worst still, is the tendency to supplant moral thinking with science: 

# Pyotr Petrovitch: 

> Science now tells us, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world rests on self-interest…firmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfare organized too. Therefore, in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for myself, I am acquiring, so to speak, for all…

# Raskolnikov:

> [...] carry out logically [this] theory… and it follows that **people may be killed**…"

~ Dostoevsky in  Crime and Punishment

Spoiler alert (!) but Raskolnikov goes on to murder his land lady because he feels himself of Napoleonic greatness and worldly consequence, murder being of course a mere pittance of cost versus his moral benefit according to his utilitarian logic. 

The WEIRD, or Western analytically bias gives a certain culmination towards Reductionism, the causal attribution of complex phenomenon to their lowest level components. I argue that this dark side nonetheless opens a door to the meta-layer of the scientific understanding of life, i.e. agents ARE statistical modelers. Sometimes reductive but necessarily are parsimonious. Agents need to model their environment not do a single casual factors, but neither can they model each potential factor. Like a good scientists they need to form a model of the environment using the right amount of variables, such that the casual representations are not redundant or superfluous.  These insights span from economics, to biology, to emotions, even to language and human culture. 

Economists assumed the self-interested agent, physicists modeled single equilibrium systems, and biologists argued for **selfish genes** (Noble 2017). Each of these claims became a kind of **null hypothesis**. Human beings and living systems are of course more complex. Yet not infinitely so. We are all stable systems that, according to active inference, can be viewed as *parsimonious models* of our environment. To understand the nature of our models, what factors we emphasize or suppress, we can look to work that tested these reductive theories.

The *single equilibrium* of thermodynamics, as taught by Boltzmann, predicts that ink disperses through water until it reaches uniform concentration. Yet the systems that matter are those that resist this outcome, finding non-equilibrium steady states that hold together in changing conditions. Friston uses this example to explain why active inference offers a better account of persistence in living systems.

Economics is shaped by the same paradox. The **homo economicus** caircuature of The Neoclassical view (e.g. Milton Friedman,  Francis Edgeworth, William Stanley Jevons, Léon Walras, and Vilfredo Pareto) is contradicted by various **neoclassical market failures**, such as one raised famously by Ronald Coase, who asked why firms exist at all if rational agents could coordinate through markets (Coase 1937). Herbert Simon argued that the pronouns “we” and “they” reveal how individuals identify with organizational goals and suspend selfish calculation (Simon 1992). Douglass North defined **institutions** as the *constraints humans impose on themselves* to stabilize cooperation, specifically *by contrasting the view of agents as self-utility maximizers* (North 1990). John D. Rockefeller and J. P. Morgan, described by Ron Chernow, recognized the importance of *cooperation and moral trus*t as the basis of finance, rather than price signals alone (Chernow 1990).

Claude Lévi-Strauss employed **binary oppositions** to define universal cultural motifs,  but Jacques Derrida revealed that oppositions are not fixed but dynamic, always deferring to what he called the **transcendental signified** (Derrida 1976). BF Skinner modeled behavior as **stimulus and response**, but Ralph Adolphs and David Anderson showed that emotions act as **intervening variables**, creating an inner space that allows for flexibility (Anderson 2022). Richard Dawkins’ **selfish gene** was countered by Denis Noble’s biological relativity, which argues that causation runs across scales, not from a privileged molecular level (Noble 2017).

Each of these contradictions converges on a theme. Human beings and their societies cannot be captured by single-variable reduction, yet neither can they be described by an infinite catalogue. Active inference offers a *parsimonious balance*, i.e. gents are themselves models that trade accuracy for complexity, minimizing future uncertainty through constraint. For humanity these are the constraints that we feel, moral constraints that go hand in hand with our ability to identify within groups and scale our goals.
