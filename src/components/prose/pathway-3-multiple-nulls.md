Modern sciences often begin from reductive hypotheses. Economists assumed the self-interested agent, physicists modeled single equilibrium systems, and biologists argued for selfish genes (Noble 2017). Each of these claims became a kind of null hypothesis. Human beings and living systems are of course more complex. Yet not infinitely so. We are all stable systems that, according to active inference, can be viewed as parsimonious models of our environment. To understand the nature of our models, what factors we emphasize or suppress, we can look to work that tested these reductive theories.

The single equilibrium of thermodynamics, as taught by Boltzmann, predicts that ink disperses through water until it reaches uniform concentration. Yet the systems that matter are those that resist this outcome, finding non-equilibrium steady states that hold together in changing conditions. Friston uses this example to explain why active inference offers a better account of persistence in living systems.

Economics is shaped by the same paradox. The homo economicus of The Neoclassical view (e.g. Milton Friedman,  Francis Edgeworth, William Stanley Jevons, Léon Walras, and Vilfredo Pareto) is contradicted by Ronald Coase, who asked why firms exist at all if rational agents could coordinate through markets (Coase 1937). Herbert Simon argued that the pronouns “we” and “they” reveal how individuals identify with organizational goals and suspend selfish calculation (Simon 1992). Douglass North defined institutions as the constraints humans impose on themselves to stabilize cooperation, specifically by contrasting the view of agents as self-utility maximizers (North 1990). John D. Rockefeller and J. P. Morgan, described by Ron Chernow, recognized the importance of cooperation and moral trust as the basis of finance, rather than price signals alone (Chernow 1990).

Claude Lévi-Strauss described binary oppositions as the grammar of myth, but Jacques Derrida revealed that oppositions are not fixed but dynamic, always deferring to what he called the transcendental signified (Derrida 1976). BF Skinner modeled behavior as stimulus and response, but Ralph Adolphs and David Anderson showed that emotions act as intervening variables, creating an inner space that allows for flexibility (Anderson 2022). Richard Dawkins’ selfish gene was countered by Denis Noble’s biological relativity, which argues that causation runs across scales, not from a privileged molecular level (Noble 2017).

Each of these contradictions converges on a theme. Human beings and their societies cannot be captured by single-variable reduction, yet neither can they be described by an infinite catalogue. Active inference offers a parsimonious balance: agents are themselves models that trade accuracy for complexity, minimizing future uncertainty through constraint. For humanity these are the constraints that we feel, moral constraints that go hand in hand with our ability to identify within groups and scale our goals.
