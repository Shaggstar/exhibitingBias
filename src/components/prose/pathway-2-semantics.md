Meaning begins in biology as **shared priors** and **generative models**. Robert Pirsig argued for what he called Quality in _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_, an atavistic motive force of life that precedes and may give rise to subject and object distinctions (Pirsig 1974). Michael Levin formalizes this view when demonstrating that cells themselves maintain a kind of valuation, holding to steady states that reflect shared information across tissues (Levin and Fields 2021). Karl Friston and Chris Frith described how shared generative models allow synchrony between agents, whether in birdsong or human conversation (Friston and Frith 2015). Synchrony allows expectations to be coordinated.

Meaning expands into the linguistic notion of **common ground**. Michael Tomasello showed that human communication is uniquely structured around **shared intentionality** (Tomasello 2016). Communication requires a horizon of relevance, maintained by establishing what each participant can reasonably assume. Walter Fisher named this expansion of common ground the **narrative paradigm**. He described narration as “a theory of symbolic actions, words and deeds that have sequence and meaning for those who live, create, or interpret them” (Fisher 1985). Biological meaning becomes cultural meaning through the same demand, i.e. the necessity of a **shared reference frame** (Levin and Fields 2020). Whereas the typical cartesian coordinate frame was built as objective apriori, drawing from Chris Fields and Michael Levin to our morality founded symbolic semantic frames we can see how we arrive at an objective framework only through prior aligning our subjectivity using a moral perspective.
