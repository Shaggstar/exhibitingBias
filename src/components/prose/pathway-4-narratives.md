Narrative allow humans to construct common reference frames. Fisher argued that people communicate through a **narrative paradigm**, where stories are rational to the extent that they satisfy narrative probability and fidelity (Fisher 1985). Narratives bind facts into a sequence, making them intelligible:

> Neither the facts nor our experience come to us in discrete and disconnected packets which simply await the appropriate moral principle to be applied. Rather, they stand in need of some narrative which can bind the facts of our experience together into a **coherent pattern** (Fisher 1985).

Christopher Booker, drawing from Jung, described stories as the alignment of the protagonist with the **cosmic self**. The tragic hero, he wrote, is divided against himself, tempted to transgress law and convention, wavering between duty and desire (Booker 2004). Stories, in this view, show how individuals align or misalign with cultural archetypes.

Harold Bloom argued that Shakespeare invented the human by proliferating selves. Chaucer, Shakespeare, Jane Austen, and Emily Dickinson became canonical in part by dramatizing the mutability of identity and the struggle of self-discovery (Bloom 1994). These literary shifts coincided with the decline of shared religious mythologies and the rise of individual hermeneutics, as Joseph Henrich has shown in tracing the roots of Western individualism.

Narrative explains how symbolic cognition expanded from mythic roles into modern selves. The trajectory is cumulative: myths bound communities, literature fractured and multiplied the self, and both personal and cultural narratives now compete to establish coherence.
