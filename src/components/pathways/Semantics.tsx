          Meaning begins in biology as shared priors and generative models. Cells hold steady states that
          reflect distributed valuation across tissue. Shared models allow synchrony in birdsong and in
          conversation. Expectations align.

          Meaning expands through common ground. Communication depends on shared intentionality and a horizon
          of relevance. Narration is symbolic action in sequence that people live, create, and interpret.
          Biological meaning becomes cultural meaning through the same demand, a shared reference frame.
