          Active inference treats life as prediction under uncertainty. Shared models enable coordination.
          Identity can be described by information flow within a light cone. Models gain epistemic depth
          across temporal scales.

          Transcendental Model Selection adds a cultural precision parameter α to weigh model choice when
          contexts clash. Morality serves as the computational integrator that selects behavior across family,
          friends, work, and anonymous society.
