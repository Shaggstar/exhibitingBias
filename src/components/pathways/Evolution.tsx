          The Myth of Objectivity tells humanity's journey to symbols beginning in the building blocks
          of social life. Infants prefer the motherâ€™s voice and then the home accent. Shibboleth
          becomes a first foundation of trust among strangers. From this point cooperation scales.
        </p>

          When social norms grow complex and people defect, morality stabilizes behavior. Gossip enforces
          norms. Infants evaluate sociomoral behavior. Moral codes balance fairness, reciprocity, and harm
          avoidance, and are widely shared across cultures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Culture grows from these foundations. Humans learn from people they never meet, storing anonymous
          experience. Teaching and imitation scaffold this process. Early symbolic markers like ochre link
          identity to symbolic cognition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Governance coordinates moral and cultural structures. Institutions are constraints we impose to
          reduce uncertainty. The trajectory from accent to morality to culture to governance shows how
          each layer scaffolds the next.
