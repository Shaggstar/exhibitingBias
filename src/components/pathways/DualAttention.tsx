        <p>
          Cognition works through two modes. Analytic parses parts and sequence. Gestalt sees wholes and
          analogy. Both are needed. Quality sits beyond either.
        </p>
        <p>
          Western culture leans analytic at the expense of holistic attention. Transcendental model selection
          requires depth from analysis and breadth from gestalt to stabilize selection across scales.
