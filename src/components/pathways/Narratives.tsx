        <p>
          Narrative is how humans construct common frames. Stories are rational when they satisfy narrative
          probability and fidelity. Narratives bind facts into sequence and make them intelligible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stories align protagonists with cultural archetypes and show divided selves wavering between duty
          and desire. Shakespeare multiplied selves. Canonical literature dramatized the mutability of identity
          as shared religious myth receded and individual hermeneutics rose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Narrative explains the expansion from mythic roles to modern selves. Communities were bound by myth,
          literature fractured and multiplied identity, and personal and cultural narratives now compete to
          establish coherence.
