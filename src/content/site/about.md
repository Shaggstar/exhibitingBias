## Current Focus

Integrating 10+ years of product management experience with research on symbolic cognition and moral reasoning to build systems that help both humans and AI navigate complex decisions.

## Research Approach

Every insight moves through three phases: narrative exploration (poetry/essays), formal specification (mathematical models), and practical testing (simulations and products).

## Connect

Open to collaborations on AI alignment, cultural governance, and products that help humans flourish in technological environments.
