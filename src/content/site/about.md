# Current Focus

Integrating 10+ years of product management experience with research on symbolic cognition and moral reasoning to build systems that help both humans and AI navigate complex decisions.

# [Active Inference Institute Research Fellow](https://coda.io/d/AII_do5M5iYau8H/Myth-of-Objectivity_su3sqfj9#_luOFZrb-)
I am actively collaborating with other researchers affiliated with the institute, in order to complete a set of simulations to evaluate the core thesis around the MOH. Is the computational perspective of morality consistent with a simulated agent's ability scale their social units to an anonymous, arbitrary large or cultural level? Does the formal framework generalize to symbolic cognition, i.e. abstract thought, language, art, mathematics, and other cultural communication mediums? 
# Shaggy moves from In-silico to humanities
My Journey takes me to three phases: narrative exploration (poetry/essays/drama), formal specification (mathematical models), and practical testing (simulations and products).

# Connect

Open to collaborations on AI alignment, cultural governance, and products that help humans flourish in technological environments.
