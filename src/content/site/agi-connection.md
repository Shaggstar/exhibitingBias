title: "The AGI Connection"
---

To make AGI we need to understand intelligence and why any intelligence, at least in biological or cognitive terms, is necessarily "general." What makes intelligence general? The ability to integrate problem solving across scale and contexts towards a broader purpose. This can be thought of as uncertainty minimization or teleology and is the core of selfhood generally.

This is why I'm excited to be part of the Active Inference Institute, because its namesake framework offers a way for us to understand cognition not only in cognitive terms, but to understand that in a very fundamental way cognition is centrally a computational process. The cells in our bodies process information as part of an integrated whole, when they lose this connection, we get cancer.

Morality, for its part, allows humanity to integrate into part of a broader group, or culture. Morality, from a toddler's impulsive desire for fairness. This was Viktor Frankl's insight as he psychologically persevered in a concentration camp, the Jungian thoughts of cosmic Self, and is generally a common thread that weaves through religious, narrative, and aesthetic traditions that emerge as far back as we can currently gaze.
