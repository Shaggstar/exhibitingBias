title: "The AGI Connection"
---

Humans had to worry about alignment way before we built robots.

To make AGI we need to understand intelligence and why any intelligence, at least in biological or cognitive terms, is necessarily "general." What makes intelligence general? The ability to integrate problem solving across scale and contexts towards a broader purpose. This can be thought of as uncertainty minimization or teleology and is the core of selfhood generally.

This is why I'm proud to be part of the Active Inference Institute as a [research fellow](https://coda.io/d/AII_do5M5iYau8H/Myth-of-Objectivity_su3sqfj9#_luOFZrb-), because its namesake framework generalizes the view of cognition as predictive modeling, to all living systems. The cells in our bodies process information as part of an integrated whole, when they lose this connection, we get cancer.

Morality, for its part, allows humanity to integrate into part of a broader group, it allows us to inhabit a cultural niche and learn from people we'll never meet or often know. Morality, from a toddler's impulsive desire for fairness. This was Viktor Frankl's insight as he psychologically persevered in a concentration camp, the Jungian thoughts of cosmic Self, it's why we're demonstrable distinct from the selfish utility maximizers of the Neoclassical dream and why we're irreducible to our genetic make up. 

Morality as a tool to integrate humanity to culture is a common thread that weaves through religious, narrative, and aesthetic traditions that emerge as far back as we can currently gaze.
