Your poem text starts here...

The immediate night I’ve been in a seemly slew

This is only what I appeared to do

 A fantasy in sleuthing imbued

I’ve wetted and sent the sentence of it’s hopeful blew

I’ve sentenced the immediate nightly noose

I’ve fled and bled and sired the shame

Now my escapade and seemingly y unenduring fame

# Original

The force of it’s might

 A long list of fright

The meaning of enticement

 A long list of fright

The meaning of it all in a spiteful light

Gleaming on it’s hill of a bespoken shinning site

An upward hill and oriented in site

The gleam of it’s sheen

A most frightful light
