subtitle: This, in short, is what i take to be the most profound questions we are able to ask of our lives. (Part 1 of 3).
---


One day your mother and I had a "chat," not long after we got engaged but well before you were born (yes, you were still just an idea). She wanted you to be baptized, not because she believed in the particular faith you would be baptized into, but because she worried it would be difficult to not have that sense of identity and the attendant belonging that comes with being born into a particular community of believers.

I objected, of course (hence our... "chat"), not because I had an issue with baptism in general (though I might have at the time, now less so) but because I didn't feel we needed to be born "into" anything. I believed that "you" (very much the idea of you) would be able to find who you were, and we would be there to help.



We would explain what we believed in, what we didn't believe in, and that would be enough given all the knowledge available, all the choices at our disposal. We would raise you as a discerning, thoughtful child who would grow into a considerate adult capable of deciding the best path for your own faith.

Though I am satisfied with our decision neither to have you baptized nor raise you in an explicit faith that would have been inconsistent with our own beliefs, I've come to appreciate your mother's ultimate view: that identity and community are both essential and generally under strain in our society.

Fortunately, should you find yourself in such existential curiosity, there are many paths available to nurture you along on your quest, whether you happen to be superficially interested or are drawn towards an intense escape from the daily grind to delve into the complexities of spiritual fulfillment.

Beyond the availability of knowledge is the particular nature of the time we find ourselves in. I believe we are in a certain existential quest. We have both the available tools—all the wisdom of the ancients condensed into TikTok reels and YouTube shorts—along with the inner drive stemming perhaps from the danger to the social fabric that scaffolds human civilization. Yet before I climb onto my high horse, let me descend into the lowest of confessions anyone can make: to admit my wife was right.

## II.

There are a couple things I got wrong. Namely time. Yes, as I'm sure you've heard, raising children takes up a lot of time (and effort). In general, life gives you time when you don't want it and never enough when you think you need it. It can also just be difficult to muster the courage and motivation to follow through on whatever it is you thought about doing when you didn't have time, once you find yourself in its possession.

But what I really got wrong was how easy it would be to both come to terms with what we believed regarding the greater purpose and significance of life... not to mention what, if anything, lies beyond it.

What your mother understood then, and what maybe my irrational belief in individuality led me to invest far too much time and energy actively opposing, is how much human nature craves identity, perhaps above all other things. Even labels, as damnable and deceptively binding as they are, generally flounder in their absence.

## III.

While it's a little hard to imagine when, if ever, you will ask the hard questions of existential purpose, given your current focus on princess dresses and marshmallows, I have little doubt they will stir your soul as they have so many others throughout time. I sincerely believe that most people do at least cursorily deal with questions of purpose and meaning.

Perhaps some find contentment in their daily goals and tasks. More power to them. Maybe others find contentment in religious traditions. Even more power to them.

However, I sense a deep inner life already well seeded inside you, by the questions you ask, the comments you make, and the things you remember. This suggests the chance that neither words of a venerated authority nor your to-do list will spare you from a confrontation with the deeper parts of being alive and living a life.

This does not mean that the daily demands of school, work, relationships, sports, art, along with the community environments you find lack the ability to provide you with meaning—they will. Indeed, I truly doubt it's possible to live meaningful lives without joining at least one "tribe," community of peers, or cabal of experts that appeal to your passion or interests. Yet, to lose yourself in tasks or community demands is generally a control switch, navigating where you fit in and deciding when to step back or whether to lean in and possibly advance in your dealings.

Here we're back at the central point with which I feel confronted our dilemma, one that only made itself clear as you came into our lives. How are we separate and apart from the world, from the communities, families, and places we are born and raised into? You were not simply born into a family; you formed the one of which you're part. Without you, it would not be nearly the same group. How can we then find a proper community within which we should find our purpose when those very communities are busy finding us? How do we engage in this dance of person and place?

Perhaps most importantly is whether you would give a damn what your Mom and Dad think of these things... and here at least, I think I know the answer.

Regardless, I suppose that hasn't stopped anyone from saying them. Just be glad this version is written and thus more ignorable than an IRL lecture. So here is as direct an account of what I believe as I can give, such that it might offer you an option to ignore, know for curiosity's sake, or serve as a partial input into your own future perspective. Because while I wouldn't imagine you will take what I say wholesale—neither would I, at the time you read this, if I'm still thinking such thoughts, even agree with this in hindsight. Yet it's a start. From someone who has known at least a part of you.

## IV.

Of the countless memories you've given me, one remains in my mind without any obvious reason. I was sitting in the chair near your crib, in the one that now belongs to your sister Joey, brooding with my head facing the ground. I couldn't tell you what I was worried about, although given how old you were and the things that troubled me then and largely do now, I could venture a reasonable guess. But what I distinctly remember is what you did. You bounced from the other end of the crib, reached over, and tilted my head upwards. Our faces gazing at one another.

I probably looked puzzled; I can't say, of course. What I can say without a shadow of a doubt is that you looked delighted. What struck me was that you suddenly changed in my mind. At about 2 years old, you were no longer just a baby in my care—you had energy, thoughts, a personality, and most importantly then, you had a perspective. One that you didn't hesitate to share with me, one that demanded that I reject my own downcast view of the world, my preoccupation with past mistakes and future, and instead brought me into the present, into your presence, your moment.

I'd like to answer your call now, the one where you demanded that whatever I was, I be there with you, or maybe just there wherever I was. Wherever I happen to be, I should find the moment. Well, now I suppose this is that trial. Where I find myself now is watching you a few months away from starting school, learning your letters, numbers, acting, dancing, ice-skating, written words, and most importantly (perhaps, speculating now...) your wild imagination. Most specifically, you've been asking what you were before you were born. You asked where Grandma and Grandad's puppy went, where GG went, and I had an answer but couldn't let it out. I left it to Mommy to explain.

What she said was true. There can be much said that is true, even if it were truth we spoke of, we could share it in a thousand different ways, many of which could have equal claim to its representation.

## V.

Okay—so here's mine. That we are open doors to the truth, bigger than ourselves and our time here. We pinball from wall to wall, clanging about, and on special occasions witness the line in the sand that trails from the sky.

This is heaven.

The infinite experienced in the instant.

The endless felt as intimate.

That is where we're from and where we end. You need no further proof of the intelligence of the cosmos you were born into, whether the night sky, the ocean, the forests, or the future that lies before you. If the universe is capable of making you, then it is capable of all that you possess. It is the best of you. Any mistake you or others make is simply a falling short, a failure to recognize the expansive awe of which ours is not just a part but the cause. That's what it means to sin, to err, or to deviate—to simply miss the mark of the direction of your intelligence and your conscious being, your ability to create plans, imagine, dream, and all those good things you've probably mastered by now.

How do we know this? Is it in the Bible? Maybe? The Koran? Kind of, not sure. It's probably there, in the Tao Te Ching, the Talmud, the Upanishads, among other notable texts. But more importantly, it's in the ground that you walk on. What I mean is that there is nothing particularly special about the stuff we're made of. You were born of dirt, ash, and the hopes of two (once) young people in love and hope. But perhaps a little empty, who wanted their cups a little more full, to feel the thrill and purpose. And there you were. Providing both, and other things.

Don't let anyone tell you  
that it wasn't anything short  
of miraculous  
the world cycled through the summer winter spring and fall  
all in the time it takes for sand to pour down an hourglass  
and out you were  
from a thought...an idea...a storm of eggs and spermatozoa (sorry)  
that clinked together into a human soul  
with hopes  
and dreams  
wishes  
and  
most importantly  
beliefs.  
but nothing in there was, per se, what was special  
nothing in there was the arrow from which your heart emerged  
you became, from nothing, more than a pail of mud  
but that is the point, point of it all.  
That the mud was made special  
As heaven is held in the piece of earth  
And to the dirt we return  
But through the world we rejoice

"Like it or not, alone will be something you'll be quite a lot."  
~ Dr. Seuss

If the next generation iPhone drops an app that genuinely dissolves loneliness, then I'd be pretty skeptical of its long-term health benefits.

There's not a person I've met worth speaking to that hasn't worn the scars of loneliness. The distance you travel in time and space to meet the people that will be additions to your family and tribe will determine the integrity of those bonds.

But never feel that you are alone. What I mean is loneliness is a feeling—necessary yet not straightforward. You are part of a cosmos that is ultimately connected; if it were otherwise, this place would look and function much differently than it does. Our bodies breathe the air, whether human culture or the animal kingdom or the galaxy and its celestial orbits—all are facets of our inherent interconnectedness.

But yet we must feel alone. We must feel as the earth does, spiraling in space, staring towards distant stars but unable to come nearer to the one closest to it, all the while with an irritating sidekick who won't leave it alone and irritating creatures crawling in its crevices. Because in order to experience the life we do, we must feel separate. This is the crux of it all. It's all some kind of puppet show, some kind of act, a game where the stakes are life and death but the nature is closer to a game you'd play from an episode of Bluey.

## VII.

If life is merely a kind of game, where we all act like separate people when really we're all one big massive field of existence, feeling our end of the infinite mass of cosmic fabric, then what, exactly, is the point? And what do we practically do to deal with the pragmatic issues of taxes and gossip and people who say things to other people while staring at us and rolling their eyes and post things on social media that they took 7 years ago and insist on having lunch only to boast about conversations they had with an ex that's no longer as important as them in their consulting firm?

Short answer? There is none.

Yes, I'd love you to get into long-form fiction. Books, yes. The ones without a charger serve only one purpose and sometimes tear and fade.

With an important alternative or complement which is poetry. Of any length.

A better answer is that the best I can tell is art in its entirety. It mirrors in its ritual construction of a perspective, whether it's of a bowl of fruit or a vibrating orchestra.

But the best I can tell is that this is the way to approach meaning, living a meaningful life.

If you must, think of novels as vegetables. Plays as fruit. Poetry? As water.

Novels will always be held over your head by those who claim they know better...an irony not entirely lost on me now. Plays are enjoyable but only if you arrive at the right time and place where they yield themselves to you. Poetry will not allow you to live without it. It shows up on walls and over songs. Though it will be with you regardless of your effort, your task is to never let it happen by accident. Meet it at its door. When you do, the rest will fall into place. By that I mean both other art forms, but more importantly, the thing that art is supposed to bring to you.

Finding purpose and understanding more fully what to make of the world—especially when it decides to spin sideways while you keep moving straight or, by chance, get stuck—is to understand the only person that matters.

Which brings us back to that frustrating paradox that will follow until the end but for notable moments of reprieve... are you a lone individual, a cowboy venturing on the western plains, or a dancer in the middle of a crowded stage, lost, transcended above the trap of your own ego?

## VIII.

Clock in and clock out. The world is nothing but a series of patterns. We are mostly trapped in them. The most trouble occurs when it manifests before our eyes, and suddenly we realize we're stuck on the same train having the same argument year after year, see the same three colors in the sky and the same three feelings in our hearts and the same three thoughts circle in our minds. It can be paralyzing, but there's a trick, of course. And it goes back to play. Once you read the hymn sheet, you can perform your verse comedy with passion and poise, not always of course, but it's still possible if you have the energy in you. If you're so inclined to ignore all that came before, to insist you take a more dour stance, and instead turn back to the quirk you were born with.

Because you will come to loathe all forms of sugar, at least for a time. You will loathe every time you sang a song in your head while you should have been learning someone's name or a way to answer a test or that you should have gone down the left and never the right.

And you'll mostly be correct. How much 'better' our now would be if only you had walked the straight and narrower.

So you do that as often as you can. But honestly?

You can still fall from the narrow path. It's not only blithe but the greatest defense to err; there is wisdom, in other words, in allowing yourself the space to slip. As often as you need it and whenever you need it. Because you can do all the right things and still come to find that it's someone else's folly that made the game never end the way it should. So you'll say at least it was grand. Grand that you had that moment stretched across the grass, roiled in laughter while the other people looked dourly at their simple fright of their final act coming to a close.

With all the love, Dad`;export{e as default};
