subtitle: To read this words (or hear them spoken) you need the ability to transcend individual perspectives and have "faith" in a common, cultural vantage point.
---
How did a meek primate inherit the earth? Symbols. Not just letters, words, equations, and even art. Simply congregating among people with whom we've never met, sitting on a crowded bus or plane, enables us to learn from countless people, past and present. It always us to identify as part of a group and exploit the fruits of the cultural commons we all inherit. 

Fundamentally this involves a frame of reference we all must implicitly (at least) believe in, a shared context that enables us to interpret sounds, etching, and *as if* it were imbued with a sort of official meaning. Whence comes this impulse for a type of generalized, even objective semantics that governs our ability to inhabit a cultural niche, one that extends beyond our intimates and family? What enables us to interpret the etchings of a page into words, ideas, expressions, and even truth?

I offer here a way of formalizing the “[view from above](https://shaggy.substack.com/p/symbols-errors-from-above),” the idea that symbolic comprehension and construction requires the inherent belief in cultural perspective, one that transcends individual and dyadic points of view that appear to limit non-symbolic social organization and cognition generally. Apes and chimps, in other words (ants and bees might be more complicated) lack what might be a specific, and necessary architecture that gives way to our general ability to organize, think, and speak symbolically.

To illustrate the point - let’s take a stylized example, where an ancient relative of ours came upon someone who was an ostensible compatriot at a campsite, i.e. they sounded like one another and decided to go out a collaborate hunt. Both came back with extra game, however only our relative first shared their food with the sick and elderly person once returning to the campsite. This surprised our relative and forced them to update their beliefs, who was sure to call the our on their violation.

## 1. Introduction:

This draws on the Myth of Objectivity Hypothesis (MOH), as with prior posts, and leverages Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle—two frameworks that generalize cognition as a process of hierarchical predictive modeling. In this view, higher levels of the generative model encode more abstract and slowly changing expectations, which constrain and inform lower levels by supplying priors. Lower levels, in turn, return prediction errors—weighted by precision estimates—based on discrepancies between predicted and observed sensory input, enabling dynamic updating across the hierarchy.

The MOH claims that to understand symbolic cognition, we should focus not on thought or communication specifically, but on social coordination. Namely, we transitioned from societies based on individual intimacy, meaning each member needed to know every other member, to one where we typed people based on an arbitrary social marker (i.e. accent bias), and finally to moral typing or classification. This leads of course to not only more abstract forms of identification but also the general capacity for abstraction, i.e. our symbolic cognition.

Approaching behavior that deviates from shared expectations that a common identity marker such as accent offers, e.g. you sound like you are part of our tribe therefore I would expect you to share food with the elderly after a successful hunt and not hoard it all to yourself, represents a norm that transcends both my own and _your_ perspective on the given situation. Implied is a cultural perspective.

In terms of Active Inference, this represents a shared superordinate predictive hierarchical level, in which errors correspond not to my own predictive model, but to the model “beyond” our own cognition. Thus we back into a cultural model, one that is the necessary backdrop to our impulse and ability to navigate a symbolic cognitive niche.

## Technical Transcendent Operator

To formalize the superordinate perspective or "view from above," we introduce a **Technical Transcendence Operator** (TTO). This operator represents the cognitive mechanism that enables agents to infer and maintain a culturally constructed superordinate perspective that transcends individual viewpoints.

This operator maps individual belief to a shared cultural belief space, enabling the dimensional reduction characteristic of symbolic thought.

## Free Energy Formulation with Technical Transcendence

Within the Active Inference framework, we can formalize how the TTO affects variational free energy minimization:

This modified free energy functional incorporates the divergence between individual beliefs and the culturally constructed "objective" perspective. Minimizing this functional drives agents to align their personal beliefs with cultural norms while still accounting for personal evidence.

TTO Enables the two complementary mechanisms, [identified previously](https://shaggy.substack.com/p/diverging-parsing-and-constructing) as a potential decomposition of Free Energy, that depict how we rapidly oscillate between top down (gestalt) attention and bottom up (analytic) attention.

Conceptual Model Divergence (CMD) can be expressed as:

## Extending Active Inference

Building on this, we can extend the standard Active Inference framework to include the TTO as follows:

For a standard agent operating under Active Inference, perception involves minimizing:

With the TTO, we get a modified objective:

This formulation captures the tension between aligning with personal evidence (standard free energy) and aligning with cultural norms (the TTO component).

## The Tale of a Deviant Hunter

How did this begin? What would motivate us to go through an elaborate cognitive process that encouraged us to transcend our own perspective, and those of our intimates and kin to view things from an objective point of view? Moreover - what motivates us to continue constructing these view points?

In line with the MOH - this all comes together when our ancient ancestor came up on the selfish hunter. To begin with, our ancestors observed behvior, this behavior broke with expectations, that expectation, it turns out, belongs to the superordinate, cultural level.

EEM directly connects observed behavior to expectations from the superordinate layer. The error signal isn't just any prediction error—it's specifically the divergence from culturally defined expectations.

Whereas this simultaneously leads to an update in our ancestor felt about this supposedly compatriot, the deviant who failed to share their spoils with the sick and elderly? It’s not enough to recognize the norm violation, this divergence in a compatriot’s approximation of their self, and righteously cast this deviant as what they are…a deviant.

- Ego Model (m₁): "Hunter cares only about self"

- Kin Model (m₂): "Hunter prioritizes family" ← Inferred selected model

- Cultural Model (m₃): "Hunter values community" ← Expected model

In total, TTO enables us to transcend our own perspective, while EEM represents the identification of breaks in that perspectives, i.e. gaining our attention, and CMD enables trajectory and a conceptual update of those perspectives. Classifying ourselves and others in ways that motivates the machinery of active inference.

These three mechanisms together enable the dimensional reduction and conceptual manipulation that define symbolic thought. By making explicit both the cultural expectations and deviations from them, while enabling inference about hierarchical model selection, this system establishes the cognitive foundation for all symbolic capacity.`;export{e as default};
