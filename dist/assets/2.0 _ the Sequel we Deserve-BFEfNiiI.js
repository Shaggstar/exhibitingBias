2.0: The sequel we deserve

Okay, let's say, in brief, I voted the other way

Obama, Biden, Kamala...but timid to say

What if i stumped 

for the hardened and powerful man of orange

a picayune prince of a picture of a picture

I urged the return our soldiers to our soil to feed that urge 

to cast the our shadow on immigrant purges

the rupture of discourse and the fleecing of courts

to butress the unworthy emergent sorts. 

bleed the aid from the hungry mouths we feed

fleece the diplomats and our collective soft power

We had our chance

to politic our dance

to fix the debt

to build our houses

to legalize the dreamers

to revamp our teachers

but instead, we see the city burn

DC in marshall law

the vulnerable in chains

for the picayune portrait of hard power`;export{e as default};
