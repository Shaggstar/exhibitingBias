The voice of her namesake

pardon the plaything

I’ve been enthralled by the shame

obsolvent of a shameless state

untoward my maker and tease the absurd 

challenge the hapless away 

seek refuge in a passing place

the dame who dared date the day

a sheepish night she staid

plainly in time to take

the voice of a fiendish feigned 

lad, timing was beyond bad

a shining time to sedate
`;export{e as default};
