Sorry, I was trying to simply joke 
but then i slowly took note
that the silence lasted longer then i'd hope'd
I mean I was expecting your laughter
Seeking a bond from easy banter
we were close friends once, but now times have shifted  
from open talks to moments strained and drifted

then i thought, through our talk
i must have become lost,
in my own thought
	my mind a new moon covered in cold fog
my soul a frog, sleeping in slowly warming water
i see i've lost a fleeting moment of promise

once against i felt unmoored
slipless in a storm
wait, now i recall your earlier words 
you spoke that life was an inescapable tragedy
but now i think, is it actually?
we are moving parts that, yes, must come apart 

but really we are always parcel and part
of this one greatest of arcs
this path of purpose are we not
always in? Returning to the whole happily
ever after the mishaps 
of mortal flesh

then i happened to recall 
returned from thickets of thoughts
and realized you mentioned
your mom is in hospice

now i can't remember
what was on my mind
but it would be in a short time 
that another great grand daughter

would emerge into the world
a hope that brought her forward
at a time of suffering and illness
and it was tragic
as it happened

but then when the child was born
the ship set sail through the fog
and her face, bore striking resemblance
in her gaze
to her great, great grandmother

rest in peace and now,
rebirth with purpose
perhaps she would not want to return

but those that remain take comfort in her next sojourn
